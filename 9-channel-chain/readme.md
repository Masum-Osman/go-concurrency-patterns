## Practical Use Cases for the **Chain Pattern** in Go

---

### 1. **Distributed Summation**

Each goroutine represents a node that adds a value (e.g., CPU load, disk usage). The final result is the **aggregate** of all values passed through the chain.

> Example: Summing load across 1000 servers in a distributed cluster.

---

### 2. **Token Passing Algorithms**

In distributed systems, token passing ensures **mutual exclusion** or coordination among nodes. Daisy chains naturally model ring topologies.

> Example: A node receives a token, performs a task, and passes it to the next.

---

### 3. **Sequential Message Transformation**

Each goroutine modifies or annotates the message and passes it down the chain — much like a **middleware stack**.

> Example: A request pipeline that adds headers, traces, metrics, etc.

---

### 4. **Chained Validation**

Each goroutine validates a part of a complex data structure and forwards it if valid. The chain stops if a validation fails.

> Example: User input validation pipeline for form submission.

---

### 5. **Assembly Line Simulation**

Used to simulate a real-world **production/assembly line** where each stage performs a step of processing.

> Example: Widget goes through paint → polish → pack → ship steps.

---

### 6. **Command Propagation with Modifiers**

Each link can act like a “modifier” that slightly alters the command before passing it on.

> Example: AI model prompt pipeline — base input gets modified step-by-step to refine a prompt.

---

### 7. **Distributed Timers or Delay Chains**

Add deliberate delays at each hop to simulate time-based operations or distributed delays.

> Example: Scheduling tasks at staggered intervals across nodes.

---

### 8. **Message Relay Simulation**

Model **relay networks** or **routing** scenarios where messages pass through multiple intermediaries.

> Example: Simulating multi-hop message delivery in a mesh network.

---

### 9. **Consensus Simulation**

Each goroutine represents a voter that adds its vote/opinion to the message. Final decision reflects combined consensus.

> Example: Blockchain-style consensus or quorum gathering.

---

### 10. **Chained Retry Mechanism**

Each goroutine attempts an action (like sending to an endpoint). If it fails, the message is passed down the chain for retry by the next node.

> Example: Load-balanced retry system for sending notifications (SMS/email).

## 🧠 Key Benefits

* Models **step-wise processing** or **aggregation** naturally.
* Great for understanding **message flow**, **backpressure**, and **channel behavior** in Go.
* Adaptable to simulate **networks, chains of command,** or **validation pipelines**.

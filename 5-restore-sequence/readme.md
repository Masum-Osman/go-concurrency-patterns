# Practical Use Cases of the *Synchronized Fan-In* Pattern in Go

The synchronized fan-in pattern combines multiple input channels into one output channel, just like the classic fan-in pattern. However, **unlike the basic fan-in**, each sender **waits for an acknowledgment (`wait chan`) before sending the next message**, ensuring a level of control, synchronization, and safety in message processing.

This distinction enables a wide range of real-world applications where **rate limiting**, **state consistency**, or **acknowledgment** is crucial.

## Use Cases of Synchronized Fan-In

### 1. **Transactional Data Ingestion**

In financial systems (e.g., banks, trading), you ingest transaction records in parallel.

* **Why this pattern?** Ensures **each transaction is confirmed before the next is accepted**, preserving auditability and consistency.
* **Difference:** Regular fan-in may allow duplicate or unordered inputs. **This pattern guarantees safe sequential processing**.

---

### 2. **Audio/Video Stream Synchronization**

Multiple concurrent streams (video/audio/subtitles) must be aligned and synchronized before rendering.

* **Why this pattern?** Each segment **waits until acknowledged** to maintain stream sync.
* **Difference:** Regular fan-in has no guarantee that frames are consumed before the next arrives. **Synchronized fan-in ensures decoding and timing control**.

---

### 3. **Machine Learning Inference Coordination**

Parallel workers generate predictions; results are aggregated centrally.

* **Why this pattern?** Workers **wait until the central aggregator finishes using a result**, avoiding overload.
* **Difference:** Regular fan-in might flood the aggregator. **This version enforces result-level throttling**.

---

### 4. **Multiplayer Game Event Processing**

Player inputs (e.g., moves, attacks) arrive continuously.

* **Why this pattern?** Server **acknowledges valid events before accepting new ones**, preventing exploits or out-of-order processing.
* **Difference:** Regular fan-in accepts all inputs. **This approach enforces input pacing and fairness**.

---

### 5. **Chat Server Message Coordination**

Messages from multiple users are routed to a server and then broadcast.

* **Why this pattern?** The server **confirms delivery before new messages are processed**, avoiding race conditions.
* **Difference:** In regular fan-in, messages could be dropped or misordered. **Synchronized fan-in maintains delivery integrity**.

---

### 6. **Replication Systems (e.g., DB Replication)**

Replicated systems must apply writes in strict order.

* **Why this pattern?** Source waits for replica acknowledgment before sending more.
* **Difference:** Regular fan-in cannot enforce replication order. **This enforces strict consistency**.

---

### 7. **Edge Device Coordination**

Sensors (temperature, voltage, etc.) send values to a controller.

* **Why this pattern?** Controller **acknowledges each reading before more are allowed**, managing processing load and timing.
* **Difference:** Basic fan-in can overwhelm the controller. **This keeps device-controller communication controlled and predictable**.

---

### 8. **Email/SMS Notification Queues**

Multiple sources trigger notifications; central sender processes them.

* **Why this pattern?** Sender **confirms message was sent (or throttled)** before next input.
* **Difference:** Regular fan-in may exceed rate limits. **This supports throttling and guaranteed delivery**.

---

### 9. **Sensor Data Aggregation**

Hundreds of sensors push real-time data into a central analytics engine.

* **Why this pattern?** The engine **only lets new data in when it's ready**, ensuring completeness.
* **Difference:** Regular fan-in accepts firehose data. **This version offers backpressure**.

---

### 10. **Real-Time Logging System**

Concurrent services log messages to a collector.

* **Why this pattern?** Logger **controls log write rate**, ensuring file or DB isnâ€™t overwhelmed.
* **Difference:** In regular fan-in, high-velocity logs can get dropped. **This ensures controlled logging**.

---

### 11. **Pipeline Step Acknowledgment**

Each stage of a processing pipeline receives items and must complete its step before new work arrives.

* **Why this pattern?** Prevents queue buildup and enforces processing discipline.
* **Difference:** Regular fan-in streams data unbounded. **This provides per-step flow control**.

---

### 12. **Controlled API Gateway**

Services feed requests into a shared outbound HTTP client.

* **Why this pattern?** Outbound requests are rate-limited and synchronized.
* **Difference:** Basic fan-in could cause burst traffic. **This offers controlled, sequential flow**.

---

### 13. **Live Comment Streams**

Users submit live comments that are moderated before being published.

* **Why this pattern?** Each comment **must be reviewed before the next is accepted**.
* **Difference:** Regular fan-in ignores moderation timing. **This enforces sequential moderation**.

---

### 14. **Security Audit Event Queue**

Events from many sources are collected and need to be verified for audit trail.

* **Why this pattern?** Auditor confirms integrity and logs before allowing the next.
* **Difference:** Fan-in alone can't enforce audit guarantees. **This ensures each event is securely recorded**.

---

### 15. **Job Scheduler / Task Dispatcher**

Workers pull tasks from a dispatcher; dispatcher must verify each job is running before giving another.

* **Why this pattern?** Prevents task duplication or overload.
* **Difference:** Fan-in can't manage pull timing. **This ensures the dispatcher remains in control**.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Summary: When to Use Synchronized Fan-In

Use this pattern when you need:

* **Flow control / backpressure**
* **Acknowledgment before continuing**
* **Guaranteed order or fairness**
* **Controlled throughput under concurrency**

This pattern is particularly suited to **real-time systems**, **distributed coordination**, and **controlled pipelines** â€” where timing, reliability, and acknowledgment matter just as much as concurrency.
